## **Foreword**

According to a report published in _ThePrint_, a new global survey confirms there are an estimated 91 lakh street or stray cats, 6.2 crore street or stray dogs, and 88 lakh cats and dogs in shelters. As per the index given by Mars Petcare (American pet-care multinational company) in partnership with leading animal welfare experts, India stands on an index ranking of 2.4 on a 10-point scale. (ZOMPA, 2021)
Furthermore, the panic that pets could be the transmitters of Coronavirus led many owners to abandon their pets since the year 2020. An article published by Times of India states that _50% of pet owners confirmed that they had abandoned their pet since the pandemic started_. The article further mentions that according to animal welfare advocates, not every pet buyer explores beforehand the pros and cons of bringing pets home. (Das, 2021)
This white paper aims to deliver an approach to improve such innocent lives by introducing an organisation called **Love Furry Babies**. Love Furry Babies is not just a company but an intention to provide these mute, innocent animals a family they can call their own. We believe that it is extremely important for a potential pet-buyer to realise and understand if he/she is prepared to support a life on their own and what can be its possible consequences. 
This paper aims to provide in-depth information about how _Love Furry Babies_ introduces a 360-degree approach on how to find a perfect pet and at the same time makes the buyers aware of the responsibilities that they walk out with.

**ACKNOWLEGEMENT**

The success of this white paper required a lot of supervision and assistance from numerous people and I am enormously privileged to have received that throughout the completion of my report. 
I would like to express my special thanks of gratitude to **_Love Furry Babies_**, who provided me with the wonderful opportunity to work on this white paper on Pet Abandonment for Love Furry Babies. I owe my profound gratitude to the organisation for providing me with all the support and guidance that was needed for the completion of this white paper.
I am extremely grateful to **_IIM Skills_** who guided me all along and provided me with all the necessary information that resulted in the completion of my project. Without their proper guidance and efforts, this white paper would have been a little success. 
I convey my sincere gratitude to all my friends and colleagues for providing me with constant support and encouragement which helped me complete my project in time.

**Regards**

### **Introduction**

The pandemic didn’t just affect humans but also took a major toll on pets. Reasons like loss of jobs of the pet owners, lack of behavioural awareness, deaths of the owners, housing limitations, misconceptions about pets being the transmitters of the virus, etc. led many people to abandon their pets. Numerous incidents of pet cruelty and hunger deaths on the streets were witnessed ever since the pandemic began.
The co-founder of _Kvaab Welfare Foundation_ (an autonomous welfare organisation for dogs), Vasundhara Anand, mentions, 
> “People started to abandon their pets at an alarming rate in the beginning of the first lockdown. This was followed by adoption requests going up abruptly in the first month of the lockdown. We realised the pattern early on and strengthened our adoption procedures. Interviews were held to ask about the pre-COVID lifestyle and detailed plans for the future. This not only narrowed down the applications but also encouraged temporary fostering for those in need. Despite all our efforts, once the second lockdown was lifted, we got about 10-20 calls a day of pets found abandoned or people wanting to ‘donate’ their dogs. A lot of people bought/adopted pets on a whim, and did not invest time and effort in proper training and socialisation, resulting in various behavioural issues. They wanted an easy way out of their responsibilities.” (Sharma, 2022)


We believe that the process of every adoption or purchase should begin with proper research and awareness of all the pros and cons. In many situations, decision-makers can be seen buying/adopting a pet with no information about the breed or the knowledge about the behavioural changes of the animal. This, in turn, ends up the pet left abandoned. Many owners continue to remain unaware of the traumas they cause to the animals after they leave them on streets to survive on their own. 


Love Furry Babies is an initiative to generate mindfulness among potential pet-owners and match them with their perfect pet. We are dedicated to provide these innocent paws perfect families and help them nurture in a positive environment.

#### **Reasons for pet abandonment**

•	**Behavioural Problems**

Behavioural problems are of the most frequently stated reasons for why owners renounce their pets. An article published by TopDogtips mentions that “In a peer-reviewed article (PDF) entitled “**Owner Attachment and Problem Behaviours Related to Relinquishment and Training Techniques of Dogs**”, scientific researchers at the University of California’s School of Veterinary Medicine found that 65% of people who relinquish their dogs report some kind of behavioural problem as the main reason for abandonment.”
Some of the most common behavioural issues observed in dogs include wild biting, aggression, excessive barking or crying, not being able to get along with other animals, and many more. While some of these problems can be easily corrected by the pet owners if given proper guidance, some might be incurable without proper medication. 
A report published in The Zebra (Covington, 2021) states that in U.S.A, 7.8% of animals are given up due to aggressive behaviour. The possibility that many of these issues can be treated by the owners themselves can itself result in a lesser ratio of pets being relinquished. 

•	**Shifting places**

Moving to a new place is reported as another common reason that has led many pet owners to abandon their pets. Nevertheless, in her report for peta.org, Why People Abandon Animals, Lisa Towell (a pet expert) has stated how a research has revealed that more than half of the dog-owners who argue that shifting places is the main cause of them relinquishing their pets also mention behavioural issues at the same time. This clearly gives away that relocation may be only a subsidiary problem to the principal behavioural issues, leading them to surrender their dogs.
According to the _Pet Adoption Statistics for 2021_, published by **_The Zebra_**, 14.1% of dogs in U.S.A are abandoned due to housing issues, making it the primary reason for canines being surrendered. Hence, thoughtful approach and proper research about the animal that an individual aims to adopt/buy can ensure less exposure to risks. 


•	**Lack of time**

Time is a primary factor that needs to be taken into consideration before one decides to adopt a pet. One must ensure that he/she has enough time in his/her schedule to devote it all to the pet. A working individual may find it difficult to juggle between work and attending the needs of the pet. 
In a peer-reviewed research report, __Characteristics of Relinquished Dogs and Their Owners__, it was learnt that the second most common reason why people surrendered their dogs is because the pet required more time and care than the owner had time for.
Proper lack of care and attention can leave an animal depressed and critical, causing many behavioural changes. The frustration that comes along with busy schedules and constant change in the behaviour of their pets leads many owners to give them up.


### **What happens to pets?**

•	**Uncertain Future**

Surrendering of pets by their owners exposes them to an indefinite fate. Even though some of these animals are taken up by animal shelters or picked up by people who spot them, some of the unfortunate ones are left to fend for themselves. 
Numerous abandoned animals continuously live under the fear of not being able to take care of themselves. They are most likely to remain thirsty and hungry for the majority of time and being exposed to extreme weather conditions most certainly makes it worse. The offspring of these animals tend to live a helpless life on the streets, constantly struggling for their survival.
Without proper veterinary upkeep, shelter, and nutrition, their health sooner or later ends up becoming worse which often results in their death.

•	**Euthanasia**

Today, many animal shelters and animal rescue organisations are fighting to have enough financial resources needed to take care of these abandoned pets. The problem has been further amplified due to owners surrendering their pets during the Covid-19 Pandemic. These organisations generally do not receive any government funds and function solely on donations.

Excluding the financial aspect, these shelters, after some time approach their full capacity of animals, they can hold in. This often leaves them with no other option but resorting to using euthanasia.

### **Conclusion**

It is important to understand that bringing a pet home means bringing a new life home, a new member to the family who would require equal amount of love, care, affection and attention. Proper research, guidance and awareness about all the responsibilities that come along with adopting/buying a pet plays a vital role in ensuring a stable future of the animal. 
From “am I actually ready for a pet” to “can I take up all his responsibilities”, an individual should think through all the possibilities that would lessen the abandonment ratio. People should realise that bringing a pet home is a big decision and not something to take for granted.
